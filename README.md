Description
-----------

The Checkmark Report is an extension to the [checkmark
module](http://www.academic-moodle-cooperation.org/en/modules/checkmark/) and shows the marks and
grades for one or more checkmarks in a tabular form. The overview displays the amount of marks, the
grades and the percentual allocation. The checkmark report consists of 3 different views. The
overview gives a complete chart. In the student overview individual students can be inspected. With
the overview teachers and students have an immediate feedback of their status. The application
optimizes the learning process because of its improved overview for all enrolled users.


Example
-------

The checkmark report is ideal when numerous checkmarks are used in a course. Thereby students and
teachers have a complete overview of marks and have an upto date status and do not lose track.

Installation
