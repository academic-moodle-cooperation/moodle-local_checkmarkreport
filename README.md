Description
-----------

The checkmark report provides teachers and students with an overview of the details of all checkmark activites in a course. In this way, ticks, grades, feedback and other key figures can be displayed in a compact form and exported in various formats.


Usage
-------

A possible teaching scenario could look like this: In a weekly recurring exercise, each unit is accompanied by practical examples. For this purpose, the teachers provide a checkmark activity for each unit in advance and after the unit the checkmark is graded.
Teachers can use the checkmark report to obtain a simple overview of the assessment of students of individual/several/all existing checkmark exercises in the form of an overall table. The display includes the number of ticks, the ratings or the percentage distribution. The report has different views. It can also be downloaded at any time.
In this way, students can also check their personal status using the table, e.g. how many ticks they have made so far (absolute/percentage).
